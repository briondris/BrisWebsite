        <p>Messes of mass brought to life, Brianna Ondris creates moments to see into different perspectives that are around us; yet over looked. Through her own cyborness, she seeks the unseen overlooked narratives or choreographed patters to find the fantastic in the every day world, as well as understand the world in connection to her own femininity. Technology has a large presence in Ondrisâ€™s work, as she sees herself working with code equal to a puppeteer working with stings of a preforming object, in this case her work takes on its own life and interacting with the audience through sound or movement, creating an innocent performance within each instance, where the code / digital puppet can yield its own voice from the rules of the coder / artist as her world has have reproductions from human presence. </p>
        <p>As a digital artist, Bri Ondris is interested in the start of art the initialization of the code, and its birth through which it is dying, getting closer to the point when the piece of art will end. The cayuse of this half life is what Brianna seeks to bring some clarity to, a moment when a  person looking on the work can find a moment of peace with the mess around them, and listen to the un heard over looked voice of the art work. Brianna Ondris motivation in creating, is to create a bridge from our natural world, to the digital horizon that now invisibly inculpates us. </p>
